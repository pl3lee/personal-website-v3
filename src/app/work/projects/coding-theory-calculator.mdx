## Overview

I made this website because I could not find any online tools to help me solve coding theory related computational problems when I was taking the Coding Theory course CO331 at the University of Waterloo. Apart from the calculators themselves, this website contains some basic definitions on each page.

This website is created using Next.js and TailwindCSS.
