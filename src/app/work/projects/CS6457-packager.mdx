## Overview

As I was taking the CS6457 course (Video Game Design) from Georgia Tech, I found that their assignment packaging steps were really tedious. There were many folders that needed to be removed, and file that had to have a specific name.

When my first assignment came back, I got points deducted for missing some steps in the instructions. Thinking that I never wanted to have points deducted for assignment packaging again, I tried to use the programming language that I was learning at the time - Go - to create a CLI tool that automatically checks and fulfills the requirements in the instructions.

## Challenges and Learnings
I learned how to interact with the file system, and how to use the `flag` package from Go.

I also learned a lot about tagging software, building Go programs for different platforms, and automatically releasing them using GitHub Actions.

Overall, this was a really great learning experience for me, and I have received several comments about the tool's ease of use.
