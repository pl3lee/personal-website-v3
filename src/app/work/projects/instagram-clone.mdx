## Overview

This was one of my first full stack projects.

## Challenges and Learnings
Typical to anyone who has first started web development, the biggest challenge was authentication/authorization. I struggled with auth for more than a week, from trying to implementing my own, to just using Firebase auth. 

Now that I know how auth works (thanks to building UWPlan), if I were to do this project again, I would implement my own that supports email/password and social sign ins.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- Next.js (TypeScript): A React framework for server-side rendering and building static websites with type safety.
- Socket.io: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and the server.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

### Backend

- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- Firebase Auth: A user authentication service provided by Google's Firebase platform.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user and post data.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- Socket.io: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the client.
- JSON Web Token (JWT): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code on the server.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out using Firebase Auth.
- User Profiles: Each user has a profile that displays their posts, followers, and following count.
- Post Creation: Users can create new posts by uploading images along with captions.
- Post Feed: Users can view a feed of posts from users they follow, with the latest posts appearing first.
- Like and Comment: Users can like and comment on posts, interacting with other users' content.
- Follow/Unfollow: Users can follow and unfollow other users to see their posts in their feed.
- Real-time Chat: Users can engage in real-time conversations with other users using the chat feature.
- Responsive Design: The application is built with a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing on different devices.

## Acknowledgement

This Instagram clone project is inspired by the design and functionality of the official Instagram application. While this project is a replica, it is important to acknowledge the original design and concept created by the Instagram team. The aim of this clone project is to showcase the use of different technologies and frameworks, and no affiliation with Instagram or its parent company is intended.
