## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges is planning out what the schema should look like. I have gone through numerous iterations and settled on the current one. However, it could still be improved.

I learned a lot about Next.js server components and server actions. I also learned a lot about authentication/authorization. Overall, this project was a really valuable learning experience for me.
